This is just a way to track cases and play around with visualizations. It'll change from day to day. Click on the 'Metrics' button to change the data that are displayed (e.g. total cases, deaths, new cases, etc.). Click on the table header to sort by state or by the values for that day.

The data is from [https://covidtracking.com/](https://covidtracking.com/).

See [here](https://booth23.github.io/Covid19-Tracker/) for the live page.

I dropped the John Hopkins data because they changed the format again. I may add it back in later.
