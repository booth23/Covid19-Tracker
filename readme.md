This is just a way to track cases and play around with visualizations. It'll change from day to day. I created this from scratch with no external dependencies.

The data is from [https://covidtracking.com/](https://covidtracking.com/).

See [here](https://booth23.github.io/Covid19-Tracker/) for the live page.

To do:
1. Add positive/tested side by side
2. Filter by state
3. Sort by column
4. Add dropdown for alternate sources - JHU, other?
5. Add day-over-day change
6. Add alternate representations (bar chart, line chart)
